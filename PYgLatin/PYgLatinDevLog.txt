<--- PYgLatin Development Plan --->
1. isVowel(character) and qIsVowel(character), to test if a character is a vowel
2. isCaps(character) function to check that a string is caps
3. findCons(word) find where the consonants in a word end
4. allCons(word) to check if a word is all consonants
5. translateWord(word) translate word into pig latin using above functions
6. isAlpha(character) to check if a character is in the alphabet
7. startWord(string) finds the start of the first word in a string
8. endWord(string) finds the end of a word in a string given its start
9. anyAlpha(string) checks if there are any alphabetical 


<--- Special Cases Accounted For --->
1. Ensures proper capitalization
2. Correct upper case and lower case formatting
3. Correctly translates "qu"
4. Correctly translates contractions
5. Words may consist of alphabetic characters only (A-Z and a-z)
6. All punctuation, numerals, symbols and whitespace are not modified

<--- Outline --->
PYgLatin is a program that will convert any sequence of
words into pig Latin. The rules of pig Latin are laid
out above.  Most special cases are accounted for, and the program has been
thouroughly tested.
